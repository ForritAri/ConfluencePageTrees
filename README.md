# ConfluencePageTrees
Copy and delete page trees in Confluence using PowerShell and the Confluence REST API. 

Tested againt Confluence v.5.6.6 using Powershell v.5.

I don't have much experience with Powershell or REST, actually this was my attempt to learn them while doing smthg useful.

I will gladly accept all improvements to this script :)
